S.T.R.E.S.S.(S.T.R.E.S.S. Testing and Reverse Engineering for System Security) is a framework for functional testing, conventional testing and security assessment about network software and firmware device.

Wireless network IEEE 802.11 had drastically changed networking world, they give an alternative to wired LAN with comparable costs. The great success of this standard focused the attention of millions of users on its features, therefore outlining also all the problems in managenment of security services. Authentication and cryptography implemented at a low level, the complicatoin of authentication protocols produced an increase of driver's and firmware's complessity used by wireless device. Any software has bugs, and its number increase with complexity, therefore becames more difficult to find them and to find unexpected behaviours.

Errors in source code can used by attackers to produce unexpected output of software, that can cause hacking of systems or all subnet. It's useful to verify the correct behaviour of all software that manages network devices, the correct protocols implementation and informations exchange.

We had the idea of a framework for testing ISO-OSI layer II software implementations, that can be useful for testing drivers, firmware and generic software installed on our systems.
